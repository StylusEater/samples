# How would you test the word count prgram?

Great question. We would definitely want to test boundary conditions. For this  
we would need a practical approach to checking whether the program detects new 
words or not as well as what the program does with the special characters it
is supposed to detect. We would also want to test the null condition where 
empty output is given as well as the "upper bounds/overflow" condition where
we feed it a very very large amount of characters, well beyond, the 32 and 64 
bit values of an 'int'. 2^32 or 2^64 respectively. These conditions should 
satisfy a good amount of checks.

# What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Unhandled states are most likely to be found when inputing values the developer
most likely didn't anticipate such as null values or very very large numbers.
